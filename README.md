# CA4-Island

1. Once you clone the project, move both the ejb and war folders into your
original IslandFurniture_Enterprise-Student folder.

2. Move src folder into the IS3102_WebService-Student folder which you are running on Netbeans.

**If you need to add the IslandFurniture_Enterprise-Student project into Netbeans, ENSURE that
the Open Required Projects checkbox is checked and that the ejb and war projects are listed below it.

**During pushing,if the error shows where the files are not local(I think?), reclone the project, replace the files with the modified ones and push the set again. It should be successful with no error.
